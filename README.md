# CS-369-AIML
My Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Assignments and projects so far
> ## In this class, we began by exploring the core algorithms, such as the knn, gradient descent, and linear regression
> > Those were implemented in python, first without libraries
> ## Later in the course, we started getting more familiar with Scikit and TensorFlow
> > Using those libraries, we explored the ideas of convolutionary neural networks, as well as how NLP and image recognition works. 
> > Note: more code will be added by the end of the semester
